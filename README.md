# oxonvib

I almost developed it using wappchat app carcase and viber bot API. What i tried doing was integrating bot API to use it as a chat. Did not work well for me but maybe it is possible. Almost finished also..  What Viber recently wrote for me is this:


"The REST API is the API we provide that allows configuring a bot and sending/receiving various types of messages from the bot to users.
We do not provide official documentation or instructions regarding integration with 3rd-party platforms. To inquire further about integration with the platforms you mentioned, we suggest you review their documentation, or contact their customer support" So they suggest using their providers if i'm right.. :))
